A simple 2D game engine developed for the Makeshift group at University of Wisconsin-La Crosse.

This engine is designed to be extremely simple to use, quick for prototyping, and friendly to beginners.  Animation should be as simple as loading in GIFs; geometry rendering should be as simple as specifying rectangle coordinates and size.  The core engine is written in Kotlin and is interoperable with Java during game development.  The graphical systems are built on LWJGL 3.2.3 and do not rely on any bloated 3rd-party library dependencies.
